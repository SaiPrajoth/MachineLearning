Certainly, here's the revised answer without the stars:

Linear Regression (Brief Definition):
Linear regression is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable (target) and one or more independent variables (features) by fitting a linear equation to the observed data. It aims to find the best-fitting line or hyperplane that minimizes the error between predicted and actual values.

Data:

- Definition: Data includes pairs of input features (X₁, X₂, ..., Xₙ) and corresponding target values (Y) used for training and testing the model.
- Example: In predicting house prices, data may consist of features like square footage, number of bedrooms, and bathrooms (X₁, X₂, X₃) along with the actual house prices (Y) for multiple houses.

Gradient Descent:

- Definition: Gradient descent remains the optimization algorithm used to adjust the model's parameters (θ₀, θ₁, θ₂, ..., θₙ) to minimize the cost function, which measures the error between predictions and actual values.
- what happens here is we lower both the coefficients and intercept to get the minimum for the Cost function or in order to the least mean squared error.
- so we use a rate to change the coefficient and intercept in order to not miss the minima.
- Example: In multiple linear regression, gradient descent iteratively updates the coefficients (θ₀, θ₁, θ₂, ..., θₙ) to find the best-fitting line that predicts the target values based on the input features.

Cost Function:

- Definition: The cost function quantifies how well the model's predictions match the actual target values (Y) for the given input features (X₁, X₂, ..., Xₙ). In this context, it's often the Mean Squared Error (MSE).
- Example: The MSE cost function calculates the average of the squared differences between the predicted target values (Y_pred) and the actual target values (Y) for all data points in the dataset.

Mean Squared Error (MSE):

- Definition: MSE is a specific cost function used in multiple linear regression to measure the average squared difference between the predicted target values (Y_pred) and the actual target values (Y) for all data points in the dataset.
- Formula: For a dataset with 'm' data points, the MSE is calculated as:
  ```
  MSE = (1/m) * Σ(Y_pred - Y)² for i = 1 to m
  ```
  - Y_pred represents the predicted target value.
  - Y represents the actual target value.
  - The sum is taken over all data points in the dataset.

In summary, in the context of multiple linear regression:
- Data includes input features and target values.
- Gradient Descent optimizes model coefficients (θ₀, θ₁, θ₂, ..., θₙ) to minimize the cost function.
- Cost Function (often MSE) measures how well the model's predictions align with the actual values.
- Mean Squared Error (MSE) quantifies the average squared difference between predicted and actual target values for multiple input features.
