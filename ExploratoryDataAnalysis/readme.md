# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Repository

## Overview

This repository contains an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project that focuses on analyzing a dataset using both univariate and multivariate analysis techniques. EDA is a crucial step in the data analysis process, allowing us to gain insights, discover patterns, and prepare data for further analysis.

In this project, we explore the dataset and provide comprehensive analyses, visualizations, and insights to help understand the data's characteristics and relationships between variables.
